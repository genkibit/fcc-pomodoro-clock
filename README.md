Pomodoro Clock
===

Synopsis
---
This is one of a series of projects for the front-end program of **[freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/)**. The goal is to build a pomodoro
clock application.

The project rubric is as follows:

+ Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/VemPZX.
+ Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
+ Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
+ User Story: I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.
+ User Story: I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
+ User Story: I can customize the length of each pomodoro.
